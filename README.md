# Ozzzzymaniac - Mushroom Defense

 A warcraft defense maps that made by using typescript and powered by **TSTL** (TypeScript to Lua)

 This is a custom version that I (Ozzzzymaniac or in short Ori) made by modify the original framework template codes
 that made by Cipherxof (trigger)

 The modified includes map building scripts, newer library, etc.

 This is the public source code that everyone can see, still there is some private thing that i have to hide.
 These hidden thing are just scripts to build the maps and and it resource like icons, models, etc.
