# Ozzzzymaniac - Mushroom Defense

 A warcraft defense maps that made by using typescript and powered by **TSTL** (TypeScript to Lua)

## Small infomation

 This is a custom version that I (Ozzzzymaniac or in short Ori) made by modify the original framework template codes
 that made by cipherxof (trigger)

 The modified includes map building scripts, newer library, etc.

 This is the public source code repo that everyone can see, still there is some private thing that i have to hide.
 These hidden thing are just scripts to build the maps and and it resource like icons, models, etc.

 This also mean that you can't build the maps without virtually rewritten the entire build script and add
 missing resources. Just a note, this map build script is a complete rewritten of the original template code

## Map Resources Usage

  This is the place to list every resources that i used and it author.
  Please note that if i miss some one or your resource is used but haven't listed here yet, please send a issue to notice
  me about that resource.
